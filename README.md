# Business-Data-Management-Project
The Project is about the analysis of the business named Pradeep Maan Trading Company. Using Microsoft Excel tools I have gained insights about the sale, purchase and inventory management.By help of Business Data Management theory Course I have done many calculations and made different types of charts which made me realise what changes should be done to the business so that it can make overall profit of itself.During the project I have discussed major important things with the owner of the business and after gaining and observing all insights I have made recommendations which owner can implement to boost up their sales of the business products. 
I feel proud that I have cleared the project with A grade.
